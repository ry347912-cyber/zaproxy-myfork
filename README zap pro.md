# My Learning Fork of ZAP

This repository is a personal learning fork of the original ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) project.

I am using this fork to understand:
- Open-source contribution process
- GitHub workflow (fork → clone → branch → commit → push → PR)
- Cybersecurity tools structure and codebase

Original project: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy

## Notes
This fork is used for learning purposes by Rupesh.
